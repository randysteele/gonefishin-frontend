# Reflection 
- This was a 2 week long project build during the final module while attending Flatiron School Software Engineering Program. 
- This is a react frontend with a RoR backend.
- I build this app because I find it difficult to find new fishing destinations near me. 
- I started this app with `create-react-app` and imported from `react-redux`, `react-router-dom`, `styled-components`, `redux-thunk`, `react-router-dom`
- One of the challenges I faced while building this app was using Redux and understand the flow of it and how to use it properly.
